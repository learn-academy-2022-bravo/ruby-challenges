# Add, subtract, multiply and divide some numbers and floats.
# p 7+3
# p 64-37
# p 15 * 9
# p 124/12
# p 32.7+95.2
# p 39 / 3.3
# p 39.7 + 15.62


# Find the remainder of dividing two numbers using the modulo operator (%).
# p 17 % 3

# Divide a number by 0.
# p 175 / 0
# zero division error

# Divide 0 by 0.
# p 0/0
# zero division error

# Variables Challenges
# Set a variable called my_favorite_number equal to your favorite number
 my_favorite_number = 13

# Calculate your favorite number divided by 2
# p my_favorite_number /2

# Set another variable called someones_favorite equal to 13
someones_favorite = 13

# Change the value of someones_favorite to 7
someones_favorite =7
p someones_favorite

# Subtract my_favorite_number from someones_favorite
p someones_favorite - my_favorite_number

# Change the value of my favorite number to be 26 times its current value
p my_favorite_number *= 26
