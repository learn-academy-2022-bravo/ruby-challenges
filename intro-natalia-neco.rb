# Challenges
# Arithmetic Challenges
# Remember that floats are numbers with a decimal point whereas integers 
# have no fractional part so in Ruby, 1 and 1.0 are different types of things with slightly different behaviors.

# Add, subtract, multiply and divide some numbers and floats.
# p 1+1 
# p 10+12 
# p 34 - 56
# p 26 * 4
# p 15/3
# p 15 % 3
# p 6**3
# p 3.0/2
# p 0.16 + 0.49

# Find the remainder of dividing two numbers using the modulo operator (%).
# p 21 % 3

# Divide a number by 0. 
# p 25/0
# Divide 0 by 0.
#p 0/0

# Variables Challenges
# Set a variable called my_favorite_number equal to your favorite number

my_favorite_number = 22

# Calculate your favorite number divided by 2
p my_favorite_number / 2

# Set another variable called someones_favorite equal to 13

# someones_favorite = 13 

# Change the value of someones_favorite to 7

# someones_favorite = 7


# Subtract my_favorite_number from someones_favorite
# Change the value of my favorite number to be 26 times its current value
# Strings Challenges
# Create a variable and return it in a sentence string interpolation
# Create a variable that contains a string and test some of the Ruby string methods
# .upcase
# .reverse
# .include?
# .capitalize
# Arrays Challenges
# Create an array that contains the name of at least five TV shows
# Find the length of the array
# Return the first item in the array
# Return the fourth item in the array
# Permanently reverse the order of the array
# Create a new empty array for your top favorite TV shows
# From the full TV show array, add your top two favorite shows to the empty array
